(Relocation assistance is available.)\n\nAWS Solutions Architects in many ways act as a “keystone”—bringing together several distinct groups within AWS that support the Intelligence Community. This is a high-visibility role where you collaborate with and influence external stakeholders (our government customers) and internal AWS teams like Sales and Platform Engineering. As a Solutions Architect on the National Security team, you will serve as a trusted technical advisor to your customers over the long haul—you are the “face of Amazon” to that customer, and they will consult you regarding a broad variety of technical challenges that are complex and mission-critical. You can build sample solutions, “think big,” and provide architecture designs and cloud enablement strategy that suit your customer’s business and technical needs.\n\nNational Security Solutions Architects are regarded as technical “thought leaders” within the Intelligence Community who evangelize emerging technologies on a conceptual level and on a practical, architectural level. Our SAs have played a critical role in the widespread adoption and advancement of cloud computing capabilities within the Intelligence Community. SAs think outside of the box to deliver results to our customers and provide solutions that are cost-effective, time-saving, and secure. As a National Security SA, you’ll solve problems at both the business and technical levels. You'll work backwards from our customers’ requirements and envision new mechanisms and strategies we can leverage that would enable agencies to operate more efficiently and better execute on their goals. Then, you'll figure out how to make the puzzle pieces fit together from the technical side and deliver the offering to the customer at scale. Frequently, you will be responsible for mission-critical solutions with life-saving implications.\n\nSometimes, the best way to innovate around a customer pain point is to create a new product altogether. This position offers you the unique opportunity to drive the AWS service roadmap to support our customers’ requirements within the complex technical constraints of the cleared environment.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is looking for early-career technologists who align with our Leadership Principles and possess a unique balance of foundational technical knowledge and interpersonal skills. You will partner with customers, AWS Sales, and several other AWS teams to craft highly scalable, flexible, and resilient cloud architectures that address Intelligence Community customer business problems and accelerate the adoption of AWS services. In collaboration with Sales, you will drive revenue growth across a broad set of customers. As a trusted customer advocate, the solutions architect will help organizations understand best practices around advanced cloud-based solutions and how to migrate existing workloads to the cloud. You will have the opportunity to help shape and execute a strategy to build mindshare and broad use of AWS within the Intelligence Community. The ideal candidate must be self-motivated, eager to learn, and ready to collaborate. The ability to connect technology with measurable business value is critical to a solutions architect. You should be able to distill customer needs into requirements and articulate technical concepts verbally and in writing.\n\nWe are looking for someone who is passionate about the following:\n- Be great fun to work with at AWS. We have a credo of “Work hard. Have fun. Make history.\" In this role, you will love what you do and instinctively know how to make work fun. You will be dynamic, creative, and willing to take on any challenge and make a big impact.\n- Enjoy working with Intelligence Community customers. You will have a passion for educating, training, designing, and building cloud solutions for a diverse and challenging set of Intelligence Community customers.\n\nThis position requires that the candidate selected must currently possess and maintain an active TS/SCI security clearance with polygraph.
