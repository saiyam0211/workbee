    "experience_required": "",
    "job_description": "Overview\nThe Sales and Service Solution Engineer is a senior technical pre-sales professional in the Business Applications domain, focused on Microsoft’s Customer Engagement solutions.\n      As a Solution Engineer, you serve as the technical counterpart to a Solution Sales Specialist . Your mission is to ensure that Microsoft’s solutions are the ones customers technically prefer and can successfully implement, by showcasing technical excellence, domain expertise, and innovation with AI.\n      You will cover the Dynamics 365 Sales & Service portfolio, which includes core applications for Sales (sales force automation, pipeline management), Customer Service (omni-channel support, case management), Field Service (on-site service management), and emerging offerings like Digital Contact Center and Customer Insights (CI).\n       In addition, because Microsoft is rapidly adding AI enhancements across these products, you will also handle AI features such as Dynamics 365 Copilot (AI assistants that help end-users in sales or service roles) and AI “Agents” (autonomous agents for customer service or sales scenarios).\n       This means having a broad technical understanding from the underlying platform (Power Platform, Azure services) to the specific business app capabilities, and how AI can augment them. The Sales Engineer effectively becomes the customer’s go-to expert on “Sales CRM and Customer Service solutions, powered by AI.”\n Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As employees we come together with a growth mindset, innovate to empower others, and collaborate to realize our shared goals. Each day we build on our values of respect, integrity, and accountability to create a culture of inclusion where everyone can thrive at work and beyond.\nQualifications\nRequired Qualifications:\nTechnical Pre-Sales Experience: Solid experience in a technical pre-sales, solution engineering, or IT consulting role (enterprise software/cloud focus) AND Proven track record of guiding customers through technical evaluations and contributing to sales wins.\nExperience in the enterprise B2B context (working with large organizations’ IT departments and complex requirements), managing proof-of-concepts, technical demos, and architecture discussions for projects that can span multiple technologies.\nDynamics 365 & Power Platform Expertise: A deep understanding of Microsoft’s Business Applications, especially Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps (Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, Marketing, etc.)  \nPreferred Qualifications:\nExperience in CRM or Customer Engagement solutions is a major plus – for example, prior work with Microsoft Dynamics 365, Salesforce, SAP Customer Experience, or similar customer relationship management and service management platforms.\nCompetitive Knowledge and Industry Insight: Given the competitive nature of this role, you should have a good grasp of the CRM/Customer Experience industry landscape and where Microsoft stands. Knowledge of competitor platforms – especially Salesforce (Sales Cloud, Service Cloud) – is very valuable.\n Responsibilities\nTechnical Discovery and Solution Design: Engage with the customer’s technical stakeholders early on to understand their current environment, systems, and challenges. In close collaboration with the account’s Solution Specialist, you’ll run in-depth technical discovery sessions to map out the customer’s architecture (e.g. what CRM or support systems they use today, data sources, integrations, etc.) and identify pain points or requirements. Using this insight, you will architect a solution approach that leverages Dynamics 365 and the Power Platform, often extending it with Azure services or third-party components as needed. You create high-level technical designs and integration plans that show how Microsoft’s Sales & Service solutions will fit into the customer’s IT landscape. Whiteboarding sessions and architecture design sessions (ADS) are a common part of this phase\nExpert Demonstrations and Storytelling: As the Solution Engineer, one of your most visible responsibilities is to deliver compelling product demonstrations that are tailored to the customer’s business. You will own the creation and presentation of demos for Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Service, and related tools, often customizing the demo environment with the customer’s industry data or scenarios. A big focus now is showcasing AI capabilities within these demos – such as demonstrating Dynamics 365 Copilot suggesting next-best actions for a salesperson, or an AI-driven conversation summary in a customer service case The ability to deliver impactful, value-focused demos is critical – it’s how we bring the solution to life for the customer, creating enthusiasm and preference for Microsoft.\nProof of Concept (POC) and Technical Workshops: In many cases, customers will want to validate that the proposed solution works with their own data or use-cases. You will lead the execution of proof of concept exercises or pilot projects. As part of this, you might host technical workshops or hackathon-style sessions with the customer’s IT team, working together on the solution. The end result is a tangible validation – e.g., the customer can actually send test cases through a Dynamics 365 Customer Service queue and see them resolved by a Copilot Agent. Successfully delivering a POC greatly reduces technical risk in the eyes of the customer and helps to fast-track technical sign-off. \nAddressing Technical Challenges & Objections: Throughout the sales process, you are the point person for answering all technical questions about the solution. This includes handling objections or concerns raised by the customer’s technical evaluators. . You may prepare technical comparison matrices or run cross-product demos to show side-by-side differences. Importantly, if any technical blocker arises (e.g., “Does your product support feature X which is a must-have?”), you take ownership to find a solution – whether it’s confirming a future roadmap item, identifying a third-party solution, or proposing a feasible workaround. You coordinate with product engineers or the global black belts to resolve technical blockers so that no issue stalls the deal unaddressed\nCompetitive Strategy and “Challenger” Insights: As a Solution Engineer, you continuously gather and provide competitive insights. In essence, you act as a “competitive champion” on deals: you prepare the team on how to win against specific competitors and you proactively manage the conversation so that Microsoft is positioned favorably on all technical points. This can involve building custom demos specifically to show something a competitor can’t do, or demonstrating how easy it is to migrate from the competitor’s system to ours.\nDrive Technical Close and Customer Commitment: As opportunities approach the final stages, the Solution Engineer plays a key role in driving them to technical closure. You work to obtain formal technical approval or recommendation from the customer’s technical evaluation team. This can involve hosting a “proof of solution” workshop or deep-dive Q&A where you ensure every last concern is answered. You might create a Technical Validation document that outlines how each of the customer’s requirements has been met or will be met, and get sign-off on it.",

Within Azure, the Azure Compute team is the core infrastructure team responsible for hosting VMs, containers, and other workloads.  \n One of the fundamental core disciplines in cloud computing is capacity management. Capacity management needs to ensure that on the one hand, there is sufficient capacity across all regions, allocation domains, and hardware infrastructure to meet all customer demand; while on the other hand ensuring that capacity is provisioned efficiently thereby avoiding overspending and COGS/CAPEX impact. At the scale of Azure’s business, managing this trade-off across the entire Azure Compute fleet is an enormously complex and challenging task, where improvements can make the difference between customer allocation failures on the one hand, and gargantuan savings on the other.  \n The Azure Compute Capacity and Efficiency (AC2E) team is the team in Azure Compute tasked with managing all aspects of capacity and efficiency management across the fleet. Our primary task is to provide a fully automated and highly optimized tracking and management system.
